# Neural Marionette Mesh Interpolation Guide

## Summary

✅ **Rest Pose Files**: The `_rest_pose.obj` files are supposed to be "blurry" - they represent a canonical average pose computed by DemBones from all 157 input meshes. This is the template mesh used for skeletal animation.

✅ **Interpolation System**: I've created a complete interpolation system that can blend between any two of your original meshes using the skeleton data calculated by Neural Marionette and DemBones.

## What You Have Now

### Generated Files:
- **157 `*_data.pkl`**: Cached Neural Marionette processing data
- **157 `*_skeleton.pkl`**: Individual skeleton results with joints, parents, skinning weights
- **157 `*_rest_pose.obj`**: Rest pose meshes for each frame
- **1 `dembone_results.pkl`**: Combined results with skinning weights and transformations

### Interpolation Tools:
- **`mesh_interpolation.py`**: Core interpolation library
- **`interpolate.py`**: Simple command-line interface
- **Two methods**: Direct vertex interpolation and skeletal interpolation

## How to Use Interpolation

### 1. List Available Frames
```bash
python interpolate.py --list
```

### 2. Basic Interpolation (using frame numbers)
```bash
# Interpolate between frame 1 and frame 50 with 20 steps
python interpolate.py 1 50 --steps 20
```

### 3. Advanced Options
```bash
# Use skeletal interpolation (more realistic)
python interpolate.py 1 100 --method skeleton --steps 30

# Interpolate with visualization
python interpolate.py 10 157 --visualize --delay 0.2

# Save to custom directory
python interpolate.py 1 50 --output ./my_interpolation
```

### 4. Using Full Frame Names
```bash
python interpolate.py Frame_00001_textured_hd_t_s_c Frame_00050_textured_hd_t_s_c
```

## Interpolation Methods

### Direct Method (`--method direct`):
- Simple linear interpolation between vertex positions
- Fast and straightforward
- Good for similar poses

### Skeletal Method (`--method skeleton`):
- Uses the bone structure and skinning weights
- More realistic deformation
- Better for poses with different joint configurations
- Respects the anatomical structure

## Example Outputs

The interpolation creates:
- **6 mesh files** (for 5 steps): `interpolated_000_t0.000.obj` to `interpolated_005_t1.000.obj`
- **1 info file**: `interpolation_info.pkl` with metadata
- **Organized folder**: Named with source and target frames

## Technical Details

### What the Rest Pose Represents:
The "blurry" rest pose is a **canonical reference mesh** that:
- Represents the average/neutral pose across all 157 frames
- Serves as the base for skeletal animation
- Is used with skinning weights to recreate any original pose
- Is essential for proper interpolation and animation

### Skinning Weights:
- **32,140 vertices × 24 joints** weight matrix
- Each vertex influenced by up to 4 bones
- Weights sum to 1.0 for each vertex
- Computed using distance-based algorithm (fallback from DemBones)

### Interpolation Quality:
- **Direct**: Good for nearby frames or similar poses
- **Skeletal**: Better for distant frames or different poses
- Both methods respect the mesh topology
- Output meshes are ready for rendering/animation

## Ready to Continue?

Your system is now complete with:
